## 🔍 Analysis Summary

1. **Dataset:** `mtcars` - Motor Trend Car Road Tests (32 cars)
2. **Summary Statistics:**  
   - **mpg (fuel efficiency)**: Ranges from 10.4 to 33.9  
   - **hp (horsepower)**: Ranges from 52 to 335  
   - **wt (weight)**: Ranges from 1.5 to 5.4 (1000 lbs)

3. **Key Insight:**  
   - There is a **negative correlation** between horsepower and mpg  
   - Higher horsepower generally means lower fuel efficiency
